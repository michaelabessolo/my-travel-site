        <h1>Why I love traveling.</h1>
            <h2>Meeting new people, Mar 6, 2020</h2>
        <p>Want to know how to meet people while travelling alone? Well, it’s easier than you think, and no, you don’t need to be a social butterfly. Right now you may be thinking ‘but isn’t it a bit weird to talk to random strangers?!’ To that we say, welcome to the dark side, friends! The normal rules of politely averted gazes and stiff upper lips don’t apply when you’re backpacking, and that’s a good thing. You’ll soon come to realise it’s the people you meet along the way who make travel such a rewarding experience.
        Whether you’re eager to meet locals while travelling, or you’re searching for a fellow backpacker to get off the beaten.</p>
